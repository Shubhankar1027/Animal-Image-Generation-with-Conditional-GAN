# Animal-Image-Generation-with-Conditional-GAN

.  Implemented a Conditional GAN from scratch using PyTorch on the Animal Image Dataset (5400 images, 90 classes) to generate new images of animals across 20 subclasses.

.  Demonstrated that the generated images can be used to augment the training data for a ResNet classifier, achieving higher accuracy compared to training without augmentation
